### Coursework for Data Science at KÃ¸benhavns Universitet.

#### Assignment 1
Use data on smokers and non-smokers found in `smoking.txt` to visualize data and perform a hypothesis test.


#### Assignment 2
Use data on discerning whether a plant is a weed or crop in `weeds.cv` by performing a K Nearest Neighbor classifier. Additionally, use cross-validation to evaluate the appropriate k-value. Use data normalization to attempt to improve the results.


#### Assignment 3
Using the same data as in Assignment 2, use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine how many principal components ar eneed to contain most of the variance to reduce the dimensionality. Plot the data and the reduced-dimension data to see how accurate the reduction was. Use K-Means Clustering to categorize the data.


#### Assignment 4
Using data on diatoms (cells), run PCA to reduce the dimensions while preserving the characteristics of the dataset. Visualize the spatial variance of the cells via their principal components. Determine how pre-processing steps like centering, standardizing, and whitening affect the PCA results.

#### Assignment 5
TBD.
